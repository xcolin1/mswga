                    <p>Most Star Wars fans can agree that so far the Disney produced movies
                        have left much to be desired. Star Wars Espisodes 7 & 9 really went out of their way to provide
                        fans with what they thought they wanted. With plots that very closely mirrored that of the of
                        the original trilogy ( with Espisode 8 being the execption). </p>
                    <p>The brought back old characters in the Han solo, Luke, Lea, and ofcouse Chewie as well as many
                        other fixtures of the fanchise. They also went out of their way in introducing a wide range of
                        new characters, casting a diverse group of not well know but talented actors. Which brought
                        great energy to the films and created much contriversy and anticipation.</p>
                    <p>
                        When it was announced that Disney had puchased Lucas Films, with a with an offer that would
                        rival many countries annual budgets. People came from far and wide, podcasting, posting,
                        blogging about how amzing the news was and their anticipation of the greatness that we may be
                        witness to in our not to far futures! When Espisode VII's trailer came out it registers millions
                        of rushed to youtube to be the first to see it. And it did not disapoint. The trailer featured
                        awe shattering visuals, a score that drove you to chills and goosebumps, and left wanting so
                        much more. It had the whole fandom in a frenzy for almost a year.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">So what Went Wrong?</h2>
                    <p>Well we will start off with Espisode VII, and probaly the best of the three. But it still left so
                        much on the table, as an introduction to the rest of the story it was great. Though as we neared
                        the end of the movie we saw that it was a complete rehash of A New Hope (Espisode IV). With then
                        had many fans revistiting the most of the ploy and realized that there were no new ideas, or any
                        realy new story introduced in the movie at al, just nice acting and pretty lights. This left an
                        awful taste in with many star wars fans, but yet there was still hope, the movie overall was not
                        at the end horrible. </p>
                    <p> Then Espisodes VIII and IX were released, and though fans still went out and payed for them
                        they, and as they say <bold>"money talks"</bold>, and history will look at them as a box office
                        sucess, but in truth they were anything but in the minds of their fans. In Espisode VIII we were
                        treated to many classic holywood tropes, from love storie, to car chase scenes. All of which
                        were did not move the story foward in anyway. The movie though original and had some promise at
                        the end, as in itself a bad movie for it's content and made almost no sense at all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which now brings us to Espisode IX. In an attempt to save the trilogy, the producers tried to
                        redcon the and provide explantions for the miscues of the previous movie. But in there attempt
                        they ended up making the same mistakes of VIII, and just remade a movie from the original
                        trilogy this time though in the form of Return of the Jedi. But unlike VIII fans were
                        objectively upset and disapointed.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Where do we from here?</h2>

                    <p> Well to be hosnest, there are not many options. Having ruined the main timeline of the Star wars
                        universe, the only choice left for disney is to look at trying something from fresh in a whole
                        new timeline, with new charcters and new stories. </p>
