                    <p>In 1977 movies were change forever with the Release of Star Wars
                        Espisode VI. The inovations that Lucas intduced and the chances that were taken changed the
                        landscape of movies forever. Lucas create new worlds that insprired imagination, and drove
                        others to imatate it. He had a story that inspired the youth of whole generations. Star Wars
                        gave use classic scores, quotes, and characters that have become tropes of the movie industry
                        and a way of story telling that was second to none.
                    </p>

                    <p> The plot itself was laced with mistery and intregue. You felt as if you knew each character in a
                        deep way that just left you feeling content after each movie. Each movie was orignal and had its
                        own distinct feel to it, and that is what made them so great</p>

                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/post2.jpg" alt="Darth Vader" /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The Iconic Dart vader in all hius glory took over popular culture
                        in still hasn't relenquished his grip on it to this day.</span>
                    <p>In many ways you can say that Star Wars has never lost its place in pop culture. You can find someone dressed as a Jedi or Dath something every of the week. There are also conventions hostd every year that are attended by thousands</p>
                    <p> But there was a unique status that Star Wars held through the lat 70s and 80s. Which I beleive was the result of how well it capture the the events of the time. Where as the Empire could be potrayed to the publics as the Axis powers of world war II or any communist country at that time. It capture the publics imagination because in a way they were living it, and could and would readly realate </p>
                    <p> So, Yes i beleive Star Wars as a movie could, with thoughtful writing and casting recapture the world imagination!</p>
